# FAQ

## What is this app?

It allows you to get notifications whenever the diablo clone event in any region makes progress. 

Example 1: America is at 1/6 of dclone event progress, and it increases to 2/6; you will get an audible notification.
Example 2: America is at 1/6 of dclone event progress, and it stays at 1/6; you will get silent notification. (Just to let you see the timestamps (confirm that the app is still running as expected in the background))

## How can I get notifications?

Start the app and press the start button.

## My notifications stop or I get an error after a while

There is either a Service Outage or you are not connected to a reliable network. Service outages occur frequently and are ususally resolved in less than 30 minutes. Thank you for being patient.

## Okay, I followed your steps and the app is still broke. HELP!!

1) Close the app, open the app, press stop, and then press start. (In this order) I've never had to do this but its always good to mention the ultimate troubleshooting steps. :)

2) Diablo2.io backend may be down. This is where I get my data, so just be patient as it comes back up.

## The app is wrong, it says X/6 status when really the status is Y/6

Thats because this app relies on human input to keep track of statuses. If someone enters the wrong status, you will get the wrong status. Be mad at people, not my poor, diligent, and loyal software.

## Does the app work for Xbox/Switch/PS5/PC?

Yes. Platform does not matter, only SOJ sales for a particular Region (and Mode) determine dclone walk (AFAIK; I only play on PC)

## I'm not happy with this app. It needs to do better

Send me an email with what exactly needs to be better. I am fine with making changes if it make the app better in a practical way. 

OR

Fix it yourself; you have the code here. 

## Closing Statement
I hope this app is useful to you, as it is to me. I do this, and all my other projects, to improve the lives of myself and other fans. 

So far, I've used it to not only kill my first DClone, but to kill 5 so far! Good luck, I hope you find similar fortune!
